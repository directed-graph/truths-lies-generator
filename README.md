Generate truths and lies based on a set of truths.

Note that this project is what can be called "silly" -- a project that does
something in a roundabout way that is architecturally more complex than
necessary. The intention was to learn and apply different technologies.

We started with just playing with Protobufs. From there, we started to try
different things and they just kept adding up. If we actually wanted to
implement a generator service similar to this project, it probably could've
been done all in JavaScript on the client-side.
